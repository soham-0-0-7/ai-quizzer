## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| Variable                   | Description                               | Required |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`             | PostgreSQL connection string              | ‚úÖ       |
| `JWT_SECRET`               | Secret key for JWT token generation       | ‚úÖ       |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`           | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API key           | ‚úÖ       |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`   | Upstash Redis REST URL for caching        | ‚úÖ       |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Upstash Redis REST token                  | ‚úÖ       |
| `EMAIL_USER`               | Gmail address for sending quiz results    | ‚úÖ       |
| `EMAIL_PASS`               | Gmail app password (not regular password) | ‚úÖ       |

## üîß Authentication & Authorization

All API routes except `/user/signup` and `/user/login` require JWT authentication via the `Authorization` header.

**Special Bypass Token:** For testing purposes, you can use `bypass` as the authorization token, which maps to user ID 1.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Bypass token must NOT be used for logout route in API request header; JWT token must always be used.

## üìà Usage Examples

### Complete Adaptive Quiz Flow

1. **Sign Up:** Create account with mock authentication
2. **Login:** Get JWT token for session management
3. **Generate Adaptive Quiz:** AI analyzes past performance and creates balanced quiz
4. **Get Hints:** Request AI-generated hints for difficult questions
5. **Submit Quiz:** Receive AI evaluation with personalized feedback
6. **Retry Quiz:** Attempt quiz again with score re-evaluation
7. **View Analytics:** Check comprehensive performance dashboard
8. **Compare Rankings:** See position on subject/grade leaderboards
9. **Email Results:** Receive detailed performance report via email

### Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing/invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (blacklisted token)
- `404` - Not Found
- `409` - Conflict (duplicate email/username)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Considerations

1. **Prompt Injection Risk:** Frontend validation required to prevent malicious AI prompts
2. **Mock Authentication:** Current implementation accepts any credentials - not for production
3. **Email Verification:** Unverified emails may cause Nodemailer failures
4. **Cache Optimization:** Basic caching implementation - can be enhanced further
5. **Token Management:** Manual token handling - consider implementing refresh tokens

## üìß Additional Notes

- Results are automatically emailed after quiz submission with AI-generated improvement tips
- Mock authentication system is designed for testing and development
- Adaptive difficulty system requires at least one previous quiz for optimal performance
- Redis cache dramatically improves API response times for quiz data
- Leaderboard updates in real-time after each quiz submission
